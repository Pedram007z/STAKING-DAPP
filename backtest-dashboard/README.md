# داشبورد بک‌تست (Backtest Dashboard)

A Persian (Farsi), right-to-left user dashboard for a trading backtesting platform. Charts keep their original left-to-right layout.

**Stack:** React 18 · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS · Recharts · lightweight-charts / TradingView Advanced Charts · Zustand · Vazirmatn font
**API server** (`server/`): Node.js + TypeScript with no runtime dependencies: phone sign-in over Iranian SMS services, Iranian payment gateways, the ForexFactory calendar, real market data and the admin API.

## Run it

The app runs on its own in **demo mode** (everything simulated in the browser), or against the **API server**.

```bash
cd backtest-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev            # demo mode: http://localhost:5173
npm run build          # production build in dist/
npm run build:artifact # one self-contained HTML file in dist-artifact/
```

With the API server:

```bash
cd backtest-dashboard/server
npm install
echo ADMIN_PHONES=09121234567 > .env   # your number
npm run dev                            # API on http://localhost:8787

cd ..
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787 npm run dev
```

Sign in with a number from `ADMIN_PHONES` to become admin. While real SMS sending is off (the default), the code is
printed in the server console and shown on the sign-in page in development. Then open **پنل مدیریت** (`/#/admin`)
to add your SMS provider's key and your payment gateways' merchant ids.

## Pages

| Route | Page | What works |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | صفحه‌ی اصلی (Landing) | Hero with a self-playing candle replay and a sample trade, product facts, features, a dashboard preview, how it works, markets, pricing with a monthly/yearly switch, FAQ, final call to action, footer. Every "start" button opens the dashboard |
| `/dashboard` | داشبورد (Dashboard) | Name and today's Jalali date, practice streak, time invested, historical time replayed, time invested by day, trades taken with the buy/sell ratio bar, overall win rate, win rate by day, trades by symbol, recent sessions with pagination, new-session modal |
| `/sessions` | جلسات (Sessions) | Search, filter by status and strategy, sort, edit, delete |
| `/strategies` | استراتژی‌ها (Strategies) | "Create new strategy" box → name + description modal; each card shows total trades, win rate, average RR, net P&L and an equity chart |
| `/checklists` | چک‌لیست‌ها (Checklists) | Centered "create" button → modal with name, add/delete items, and a "required?" switch per item; edit, duplicate, delete |
| `/journal` | ژورنال (Journal) | Every trade, filterable by session, strategy, symbol and result, with notes per trade |

| `/settings` | تنظیمات حساب (Account) | Name, profile picture upload, subscription renewal, theme, clear data or restore the sample data |
| `/login` | ورود / ثبت‌نام | Phone number → SMS code (5 digits by default); new numbers also give their name. Candlestick chart on the left half |
| `/billing` | اشتراک و پرداخت | Plans, discount codes, gateway choice, payment history; the bank sends the user back here with the result |
| `/support` | پشتیبانی | Tickets with replies from the admins |
| `/admin/*` | پنل مدیریت | Overview, users (search, ban, plan changes, admin role), plans, transactions and refunds, discount codes, gateways (with connection test), SMS (provider, test, bulk messages, log), tickets, economic calendar sync, symbols and market data sources, site settings, audit log |
| `/replay/:id` | Chart (Play button) | Candlestick replay with play/pause, step, speed and a skip-a-day button; 5m–1D timeframes; buy/sell with risk %, stop in pips and RR; SL/TP filled automatically as candles advance; a session checklist must have its required items ticked before an order goes through |

### Session row
The Play button opens the chart. The chevron expands a summary: an equity curve, monthly performance for the last 3 months (USD) and daily performance for the last 6 days.

### New-session modal
Name, account balance, assets (multi-select with search), strategy (dropdown of your strategies, or create one inline), optional checklist, and start/end dates. The date picker lets you pick the **year and month first**, then the day of that month, in either the Jalali (شمسی) or Gregorian (میلادی) calendar. The end date has +1D / +1W / +1M shortcuts.

### Sidebar
The menu items, then Account Settings, then the profile picture, current subscription, days remaining and a progress bar that empties as the subscription runs down. On desktop it collapses to icons; on phones it is a drawer.

## Data

- Sessions, trades, journals, strategies and checklists are stored per account in the browser's `localStorage`.
- The demo account loads **sample data** (sessions, strategies, checklists, about 230 trades and 8 days of practice time) so every page has content. Real accounts start empty. Settings → داده‌ها can clear it or restore it.
- **Demo mode** (no `VITE_API_URL`): accounts, payments and admin data are simulated in the browser (`src/services/localBackend.ts`); market prices are **synthetic and deterministic** (`src/lib/market.ts`), a seeded random walk per symbol expanded into 5-minute bars; the economic calendar is a sample built from the real release schedules.
- **Server mode**: prices are real 5-minute bars from Dukascopy (forex, metals, energy, indices) and Binance (crypto), loaded by `src/services/marketFeed.ts` in 30-day chunks around the replay cursor. The chart waits for the bars it needs before stepping, so orders always fill on real prices. The calendar comes from ForexFactory.
- Time invested counts 15-second ticks while the chart page is visible. Historical time replayed is the market time you have stepped through.

## API server (`server/`)

| Area | What it does |
|---|---|
| Sign-in | `POST /api/auth/otp`, `POST /api/auth/verify`. Codes are stored as HMACs, expire (120 s by default), allow 5 tries and one resend per minute; requests are rate limited per IP and per number. Sessions are random bearer tokens (30 days) stored hashed. |
| SMS (پیامک) | Kavenegar (verify lookup), SMS.ir (verify template), Melipayamak (shared service number, REST or console API), Ghasedak (OTP template), FarazSMS / IPPanel (pattern). With a template set the code goes through the provider's OTP service; otherwise as a normal message. In the template field, `id:VARIABLE` sets the template's variable name. Every message is logged. |
| Payments | Zarinpal (v4), Zibal, IDPay, NextPay and Pay.ir, each with its sandbox. Checkout registers the payment, the browser goes to the bank, the bank returns to `/api/payments/callback/<gateway>`, and the server verifies it server-to-server (and checks the amount) before extending the plan. Repeated and forged callbacks are ignored. Unfinished payments expire after two hours. |
| Calendar | ForexFactory calendar pages (with actual values) by week, cached; past weeks are fetched once, the current and next week refresh hourly; the weekly JSON feed covers the current week if the page is blocked. Weeks that cannot be fetched are filled from the sample calendar in the app. |
| Market data | `GET /api/market/days?symbol=EURUSD&from=2024-01-01&to=2024-01-30`: Dukascopy minute candles (`.bi5`, decoded by a built-in LZMA decoder) or Binance klines, aggregated to 5 minutes and cached on disk per day. The source per market is chosen in the admin panel. |
| Admin | Everything under `/api/admin/*` that the admin panel uses, with input validation and an audit log. |

Data lives in `server/data/` (`db.json` for accounts, payments and settings; `news.json`; `market/` for cached bars).
The database is one JSON file written atomically, which fits a single server process.

```bash
npm test          # 27 tests: sign-in, payments (simulator and each gateway's verify flow), SMS providers, calendar and market parsers, admin API
npm run typecheck
npm run build     # bundles to dist/server.mjs; run with `npm start`
```

### Deploying

See **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)** for the step-by-step guide. In short: `npm run release -- https://your-domain`
builds the app and the self-contained `server.mjs` on your computer; on the server, nginx serves the app and
proxies `/api/` to the API server, which systemd keeps running. Ready-made files are in `deploy/`
(nginx site, systemd unit, and a relay for servers inside Iran that cannot reach Dukascopy, Binance or ForexFactory).
